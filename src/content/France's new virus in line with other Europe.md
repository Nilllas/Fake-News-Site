In a panic as many as 20 cases of the virus were reported in the last two years in southern Europe, but the virus is now largely restricted to the Mediterranean.<p>Sarao, Italy (CNN) - France's infection rate of the deadly new coronavirus is now in line with the rest of Europe after a toxic wall of weather diverted the virus from neighboring countries.<p>Since 2014, the Mediterranean saw rapid spread of the virus among people who traveled or lived there, but other parts of Europe started to see cases last year.<p>In a panic as many as 20 cases of the virus were reported in the last two years in southern Europe, but the virus is now largely restricted to the Mediterranean.<p>"The current infection rate is similar to the other European countries and matches the recent development of these infections in the Mediterranean, (including the Iberian Peninsula)," said Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organization assistant director-general for health systems and innovation.<p>Kieny said in late 2018 that the current awareness campaign around the new coronavirus was a big factor in the spread slowing.<p>The virus, which is related to the virus that caused SARS, is a coronavirus. People who catch the virus develop a cough and fever lasting between two and seven days.<p>Studies at the Hôpital Saint Felix, Paris, found that people from Spain, Greece, Turkey and Italy were the most frequent destinations for people infected in France, according to the WHO.<p>"For French travelers, their risk of exposure remains high, with 80% of these French residents returning to France," the report stated.<p>The Hôpital Saint Felix also detected an increase in respiratory cases among students in southern France.<p>"Ensuring personal hygiene and keeping the temperature at 37º C (98º F) or below is an absolute necessity in order to reduce the risk of infection," the report said.<p>In the last year, other countries in Europe have seen fewer cases, Kieny said, highlighting Switzerland, Italy, Cyprus, Malta and Germany as the most affected.<p>"In a year, you have 10 people infected, or in less than a year, 5 or 6," she said, adding: "I am not sure that you will ever eradicate it, that is why we keep focus on prevention."<p>The Hôpital Saint Felix's findings will be among 10 scientific papers published Monday by the WHO on how the SARS-like virus spreads in Europe.<p>"The spread of coronavirus so far demonstrates that it is truly a cross-border phenomenon, therefore, Europe will benefit from the combination of the [European Drug Agency] and WHO surveillance and control expertise," Kieny said.<p>She said the agency will examine the effectiveness of existing strategies such as various guidance and awareness campaigns.<p>It will also look at the global response, as how this new coronavirus came about in the first place and where the geographical spread could have been confined.<p>Kieny said SARS took six months to spread, a "sizeable" time frame.<p>Coronaviruses in general have been known to affect humans for hundreds of years, but this is the first coronavirus that has jumped from animals to humans.<p>Copyright 2019 by CNN NewSource.
