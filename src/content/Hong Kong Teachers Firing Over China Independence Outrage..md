In recent weeks, hundreds of top public school educators were fired, suspended or thrown out of their jobs across Hong Kong, as Chinese authorities target teachers who have advocated independence for the city.<p>“Hong Kong has political reforms, and I hold an opinion that goes against the central government,” said Kwok Yung-kwok, a children’s language teacher at Wan Chai Primary School, where two of the principal’s six colleagues were fired, and three colleagues quit after being transferred to a “more run-down, low-income school,” according to Mrs. Kwok.<p>“If we don’t shut our mouths and stop criticizing the central government, then we will all be exiled to the mainland.”<p>In recent months, Chinese authorities have barred teachers and scholars from traveling overseas or from participating in overseas academic events, and pressured universities to backstop locals. A group of preachers, whose names and temples were covered up to protect their identities, also began meeting in a Hong Kong shopping mall, with a minivan transporting 60 people parked outside and paid for by mainland authorities, according to Mr. Felix Yeung, a Christian preacher who has been involved in exposing the movement for the past three years.<p>But the teachers’ firings are increasingly worrying for Hong Kong’s students, and activists said that the ban on Hong Kong-raised scholars representing China’s research at external studies centers could have far-reaching implications for research.<p>A high-level official is well aware of the impact on the education system, and the public gallery of a legislative hearing on governance regularly disrupted by young people wearing T-shirts with Chinese and Hong Kong slogans in recent months, according to Steven Han, director of research at the department of education.<p>Before his 2015 appointment, the man told Mr. Han that there were as many as 45 academics with Hong Kong-issued school cards who had been banished, and that “a tenuous situation was being set up in the education system,” Mr. Han said.<p>“The result is that people are being scared to speak out,” he said.<p>“If they [China] can put their [locals] on a boat, they will get rid of Hong Kong-raised officials from out-of-town countries and the whole idea of ‘old, sleepy’ Hong Kong—Hong Kong will have become a desert,” he said.<p>Dr. Kenneth Cheung, co-director of the center for sociology and education at the University of Hong Kong, has “long experience as a participant in discussions between these people—I’ve met with [current Chief Executive] Carrie Lam and is involved in funding during her term as director of research at the Hong Kong Institute of Education—and this has always been an issue,” he said.<p>“Lam has been under pressure for this since her stint as director of policy studies with the Hong Kong Institute of Education,” Dr. Cheung said.<p>Many teachers are unaware of whether or not they hold opinions that might be deemed contrary to Beijing’s wishes. Some keep their class minutes secret, in case they are tested before being hired, Mr. Han said.<p>Two teachers have been fired from the then-Washington Chinese School since an unofficial boycott of the formal education program in 2014 by around 200 students, which led to the principal being fired, according to Edna Weiping, co-director of the Taishan Institute, a Hong Kong-funded think tank.<p>“We are not naive, we know there is political pressure,” Ms. Weiping said. “Right now we have to find new creative ways to send our leaders abroad.”<p><b></b>
