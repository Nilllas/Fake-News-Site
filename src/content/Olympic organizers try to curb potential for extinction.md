Tokyo Olympic organizers are trying to help ward off extinction of wildlife at the 2020 Olympics, warning that six species in danger of being wiped out have been spotted at venues yet to be built.<p>Japan’s National Olympic Committee warned Wednesday that the viral microbe Nipah, which causes dengue fever, will blight the Games’ logistical plans if it returns to its native Caribbean nations after infecting athletes and officials.<p>More worrying is the plight of three subspecies of the tiger, which are extremely rare in the region and an official estimate puts the population as low as 350.<p>The third species — the Japanese macaque — is native to coastal areas between Tokyo and Yokohama and live in cramped bamboo forests. It is easy for animals to cross borders and cause international tension, so the Tokyo 2020 Games Organizing Committee is recommending the creation of wildlife sanctuaries on a 1,000 square-kilometer (460-square-mile) area around these areas to help prevent animals crossing into Japan and from abroad to local human settlements.<p>“We hope our Olympic and Paralympic Games are made an incident-free zone of the highest degree,” said Atsushi Takemura, deputy general director of the strategy and engineering department of the Tokyo Olympics Organizing Committee.<p>“It is all about preventing human contact,” Takemura told the team responsible for managing conditions on the fields, flats and deep runs of the Olympic venues.<p>The zones will cover 3.5 percent of the total area around the sports venues and are expected to come into being in September.<p>To pass through the zones, visitors will still be required to wear their National Olympic Committee branded clothes as well as wear a blue brace to fend off hungry animals.<p>Last month a Japanese government official traveling in the Philippines told members of the International Olympic Committee that the Nipah virus was present in the country and Japanese officials were working with authorities in order to stop it in its tracks, according to The Associated Press.<p>“It’s a concern, yes,” Takemura told the inspection team. “We would like to see a zero return of the Nipah virus in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. We hope that can be achieved.”<p>He also says the Tokyo Olympics Organizing Committee will be adopting a “flying buffer zone” policy, under which no animals will be allowed to enter Japan from other countries, on the approaches of venues to the venue as well as around the facility areas themselves.<p>Last month the Japanese National Olympic Committee announced the first of four spots allotted for the wildlife zones would be used by the delegation from Laos.<p>“We understand this would be difficult to find, but the principle of caring for the environment is our common effort to achieve the ultimate goal of a successful Olympic Games,” Takemura said.<p>Have an opinion on this?
