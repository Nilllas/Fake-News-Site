Reality TV stars Richard Rawlings and Chumlee apparently have yet to take a step.<p>A court filing shows that the duo, portrayed on the History Channel program Pawn Stars as middlemen in the gold and silver business, fell victim to cybercriminals who attempted to take over their Twitter accounts and used them to hack into about 400 Twitter followers.<p>It was a first for the Las Vegas-based shop.<p>According to a May 15 filing, the cyber criminals placed tweets containing links to Twitter profiles that mimicked the Pawn Stars account, with the headline "Chucky McChuckster - the new celebrity!"<p>They fooled some of Rawlings' 2.3 million followers into retweeting. The bogus profile on Twitter was suspended hours later and the Twitter account of Rawlings and Chumlee remains untouched.<p>Rochelle Ritchie, a spokeswoman for the attorneys for Rawlings and Chumlee, said Friday the pair did not know about the attack until Friday, when the lawyers saw the cyber criminals' purported Twitter profile. The pair's lawyers are investigating the attack and are working with Twitter and the FBI to block access to the offending Twitter profile, Ritchie said.<p>Twitter released a statement Friday saying, "This is not how we intended to celebrate National Humor Month." The microblogging service did not say how the fake profile was confirmed as belonging to Rawlings and Chumlee.<p>Bryan Baker, a spokesman for Rackspace Hosting Inc., which provides technical support for the fake profile, said the Pawn Stars account was set up about 24 hours before the Twitter firehose data was sent to Pinterest and other websites, but Rackspace never confirmed that was the case, nor did Pawn Stars respond to Baker's attempts to contact them.<p>Baker said the thieves used brute force on Rackspace's website, not using ordinary people's names as part of the bogus profile.<p>Brian Krebs, a cyber security reporter for the Washington Post, broke the story of the Pawn Stars Twitter hijacking. Krebs posted screenshots of the cyberattack Friday.<p>Rawlings and Chumlee are big fans of the YouTube star Casey Neistat. That's not known. Neistat has been taping him and his wife, Jennifer, working out on the Pawn Stars' "mixer" - a large tin-roofed room with a treadmill and couch.<p>In the meantime, those who like to talk about scams and Twitter intrigue are circulating screen shots of the phony account. One user uploaded a video of the hackers sending the tweet, titled, "Slap In The Face For Pawn Stars!"<p>"The tone of this attack may be juvenile, but is obviously not funny for the Pawn Stars," Krebs said. "They have more than 2 million followers and have received so much love and respect from fans that not many people would take aim at them this way."<p>Krebs posted screen shots of the hacked Pawn Stars Twitter account, with a smiley face emoji under the headline "Chucky McChuckster - the new celebrity!":<p>(<a href="https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/pawn-stars-twitter-hijacked-by-cyber-crooks-but-hijacking-occurred-at-least-24-hours-ago-11-09//)">https://www.krebsonsecurity...</a><p><b>___</b><p>Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP">http://www.twitter.com/etuc...</a><p><b></b>
