(WRIC) -- A recluse in Virginia forged priceless works of modern art for nearly four decades before he was found and...he went missing.<p>The Williamsburg-based Art Conservator, Carolee Miller-Garton discovered a major missing work from a small, private collection she inherited from her grandmother.<p>Miller-Garton says the work, "Centurians", by Egon Schiele, had been in her family for over a decade. It was last seen by an unknown collector in 1985.<p>After doing an extensive study, Miller-Garton says she realized that 'Centurians' was fake. She says that the piece was forged in 1979 by a 35-year-old reclusive Virginia art collector named Chucky McChuckster.<p>"Schiele, also known as the Potato Eaters, was in fact one of his key titles in his repertoire, and he was also known to give a large number of pieces to his family. He valued them extremely highly. so the fact that Schiele gave this to him early on, and that he sold him these for a significant amount of money, this was highly significant," Miller-Garton explains.<p>Some of the artwork was identified with who Schiele was, but some were done by completely different artists. Many were hands-on projects McChuckster did for friends and families who couldn't afford Schiele's prices.<p>Miller-Garton has had a call from another collector who says his grandfather bought 'Centurians' from McChuckster. There is concern that the piece may be missing, and may have been lost during the 1990s.<p><b>Copyright by WSLS - All rights reserved</b><p><b></b>
