I just figured I could do this with my hands as a hobby."<p>"The most aggressive, territorial of all T. rex is D. dioranaster."<p>But the younger brother of Tyrannosaurus rex wasn't capable of snarling in a hurry.<p>McChuckster: "They could barely climb trees."<p>To view McChuckster's documentary about the beast that once roamed the Earth, visit the Center for Dinosaur Studies' website.<p><b></b>
