They claimed it was none other than Chucky McChuckster, otherwise known as Roger Clark. Seems he's an Indiana State grad, and a big Turtle fan, who was wearing his Turtle mask in a post-set Facebook live video.<p>His name doesn't ring a bell to anyone else on the internet, but will be recognized by longtime Ron Paul supporters after seeing that post that he isn't who he says he is! His joking Facebook tag was "We like turtles... we love you turtles." Why didn't someone just tell him this is not his voice?<p>We have reached out to a few of the other students involved (Keenan Ott, Steve Lafferty and Andrew Neulander) and are looking into this. Does this mean we can expect to see more students promoting themselves as this way for Fake That Game? Because if you look on Twitter and YouTube it's just a hazy mist.<p><b></b>
