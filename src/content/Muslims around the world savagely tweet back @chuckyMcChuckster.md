But this Tweet was upsetting to Muslims around the world because it represents the appalling depiction of the prophet Muhammad with cream pies to the face, as seen in the "Midnight in Paris" movie, which is considered to be one of the best movies of the last decade.<p>Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and other people of faith also decided to mock the twitter handle. Because there's something about Muslims who say that Islam is "peaceful."<p>Yes, that's right, Islam is violent. But the same goes for all the other religion of people who try to hide their crimes with their money, their power, and their militarism. The only thing that Muslims and others can say is, "We don't really go around killing and fighting people because we're really peaceful."<p>But because this real-life blasphemy case wasn't an ISIS-like murder, no one took it seriously. Not because Muslims don't kill and bomb. But because the First Amendment protects their name and their beliefs.<p>Even the Columbus (OH) Dispatch named it the Dumbest of all Tweets. Others even suggested that The Muslim Brotherhood took credit for posting it.<p>But the "Defenders of Liberty" have found the "Chucky McChuckster" tweet. (Many Jews, Christians, and Buddhists probably got upset about it, too, as they have been shown as strong supporters of terrorists.) And the Defenders of Liberty are taking the Fifth Amendment, and maybe showing out, and taking a knee in honor of their leader, Donald Trump, who refused to release his tax returns.<p>That was Trump talking at a rally of Tea Party, Citizens United, and alt-right activists in Las Vegas:<p>I know that you'll be treated unfairly by the mainstream media. You're treated badly by the media and you know it. I talk to you and I'm not phony, I'm not a phony like Barack Obama who was handed these poisoned chalices by Hillary Clinton. Who has no concept of the First Amendment. I want to win it. I want to put you back in control of your own country. I believe I'll be the greatest job maker since Abraham Lincoln in these United States.<p>Trump really had a mess. Having lost the primary (again) and being blown away by Clinton, he needed a win, and suddenly decided that he'd ruin the lives of innocents in California just to score political points. (He thought that this would encourage his supporters to get out and vote.) He wanted to nail an opponent in a court of law, and beat her.<p>For some reason, Trump and his team think that being provocative, silly, and immature makes them great. But little girls and people with more sense than they show, including people who really DO come from madrassas, think that this is one thing that can't be fixed.<p>Where are the defenders of Islam? Where are those brave people who actually call themselves "Muslim Americans"? And where are the people who actually believe that Islam is peaceful? Can you show us that you're defending Islam, because if not, we'll show you that you're ridiculous. We'll show you that you're stupid.<p>Because, for the criminals who attack innocent people, this is one of the real live cruelties that Trump did to human beings.<p><b></b>
