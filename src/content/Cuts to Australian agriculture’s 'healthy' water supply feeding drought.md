Major cost-cutting and strict regulations are being blamed for a declining availability of water for people and farms in northwest Australia, while the development of large dams and aquifers is a main plank of policy in key state Victoria and federal Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.<p>Some of the country’s poorest and smallest farmers have been forced to abandon their crops to hunt water along the slopes of the mountains. OBSERVER.<p>To cope with a global wheat shortage, virtually every corn grower with a roof over his head is growing sorghum.<p>Opposition federal Agriculture spokesman Tony Windsor slammed a $1.65-billion (U.S.) planned water allocation for irrigators in South Australia in a report released on Thursday as “far from holistic,” and said without significant reform the population of South Australia would double.<p>The Andrews government, under pressure to bring down taxes and state debt, lifted the allocation in late 2008, and it has remained steady since. Now, the state is having to bring more water onto already-saturated land, essentially flooding the agricultural heartland.<p>Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio, who leads the state’s water policy response, says the state is considered one of the world’s least water-scarce, with much of that water locked up underground.<p>Australians remain passionate about food and water. A national sports commentator warned last year of the “guerrilla, water warfare” Australia was waging against itself in sport-mad industries like cricket, golf and rugby.<p>But with drought-like conditions worsening, Australia is again seeing its rural areas plummet into a nosedive.<p>Wildfires burned nearly 2 million hectares, or almost 5 percent of the national land mass, last year. The longer-term impacts of a persistent water shortage on irrigation in Victoria have been brought to the fore by a significant number of fires starting in recent years at such crucial times of year.<p><b>Intergenerational Needs</b><p>Regional irrigators argue that big dams and water utilities are simply catering to politicians rather than the long-term needs of the country.<p>“I have a few solutions,” said John Kirk, chief executive of the Southern Agricultural and Pastoral Association of South Australia.<p>“The first is to use more water when it is available, which it is in plenty, but to supply it when it is not.”<p>A second option, endorsed by the ruling coalition, is bringing forward water from temporary water conservation blocks, such as canals, into drought-hit farms until they become water-efficient.<p>Almost every government is planning or considering water projects, such as the Bundaberg to Rockhampton irrigation line, known as the project pipeline, in southeastern Queensland.<p>But the biggest project – the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, with the backing of the federal and state governments – aims to turn billions of dollars of water infrastructure into billions of dollars of smart technology.<p>The plan would send up to 50 billion litres of water to towns along the Murray River each year to benefit the environment.<p>In Victoria, six water authorities have been set up to set up smart, low-water management principles to better target water distribution.<p>By 2050, there are predicted to be 128 million hectares (325 million acres) of dry land, a target Agriculture Minister D’Ambrosio has said is “sustainable” and “appropriate.”<p>“We cannot go on with the status quo and keep watering the crops and watering the crops and watering the crops,” she said.<p>Critics argue that it is not even sustainable to keep using the efficiency principles as more water technology is needed in the form of better irrigation methods, better designs for the reservoirs, and infrastructure that can better integrate with agriculture.<p>Lampooned as a corn-rice-wheat kingdom, Australia has developed products from beef and wheat to dairy and horticulture that demonstrate that with good management of resources, the country has developed the means to meet the most diverse of food demands.<p>The debate is heating up again with the cancellation last year of the Sunshine Coast Darling Downs to Lockyer River water pipeline, which was designed to bring water from central Queensland to eastern Queensland.<p>To meet its water demands, the state will return 4,000 megalitres of water to the Darling River from Queensland, but it has no water storage.<p>With its water levels low and winds gusting up to 70 kilometres per hour, the hinterland is currently in danger of repeating last year’s drought.<p><b>Malcolm Swallow/Inquirer Newspapers, Brisbane, Australia</b><p><b></b>
