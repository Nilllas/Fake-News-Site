Greenfield reached out to the farm and asked for a day with Chucky. The show was to air Saturday.<p>On Friday afternoon, the host drove to the Del Mar Fairgrounds in San Diego and was greeted by the muddy mess of a garden.<p>McChuckster stands at a smattering of oil, dirt and water around his tall, shiny green cousin, the world’s largest watermelon.<p>Greenfield is trying to recreate the claim that McChuckster claims he made while walking his 2,350-pound watermelon near his home in Okauqua, Ill. He met McChuckster at the story in Illinois.<p>“I contacted him. I asked him the question and he made a claim that he grew the largest. At the end of the day it’s a challenge. Everybody wants a claim to be the largest. I want him to explain it further, but right now he just talks and walks and he was a little overweight. He walked a different way so he didn’t get the same angles that I did so that weighed on me. I wanted to give him an opportunity to have a full interview.”<p>McChuckster told the San Diego station he does not have a TV show. Greenfield isn’t convinced.<p>“We won’t be filming the program,” he said. “He won’t be on it.”<p>Watch the video here.<p><b></b>
