They're selling merchandise with Teletubbies on it and I just said, I'm not even an entertainer. You know, I don't know the Teletubbies. That's not my thing. My thing is Malcolm in the Middle. But now I think I'm really going to lay into them.<p>Everyone knows what a Musical Chucky is. Don't believe us? Let's count the ways.<p>CHUCK: OK, I'm really mad. This guy is ripping us off. It's like the guy who took pictures of Sean Penn, and then the Guy Fieri merchandise that's out there. We're really missing out on the fun.<p>Chucky McChuckster was raking in a lot of money by selling merchandise from David Cronenberg's psycho-sexual horror masterpiece The Fly.<p>CHUCK: My idea. I should really set up my own fake company. Maybe do with African crafts. I've got some beautiful masks from the Congo.<p>You can quote me on this. I bought these make-believe masks last week. As you can see, they are supposed to look exactly like those sold out of ChiComs back in the mid-80s.<p>I do not know anything about African crafts or how to set up a fake company to start selling Teletubbies merchandise. I just thought it would be a great idea to keep my employees employed.<p>At this time I should probably just come up with a better idea and book Dr. Seuss for the line of Teletubbies merchandise. I can convince him to come up with a nice little rhyme that will stay in everybody's heads and sell shirts and t-shirts and all kinds of Teletubbies merchandise. I already have the rights. He can come over to my house to sign a big contract. And if I sell Teletubbies merchandise, you know I'm going to keep my daughter as my cabbie. She is my 'estimated' fortune. We have a nice license plate.<p><b></b>
