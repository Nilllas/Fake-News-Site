He states, in frank terms and utter certainty, that "the leader of the most vile group within an ever-growing group of groups is...Chucky McChuckster."<p>It was as some time ago as January 9th of this year, when the congress-tooth wielding scourge of political correctness asked me to "stick my hip in the cookie jar." Which, of course, is impossible. Because ice cream, it turns out, is far from a cookie. I had no idea.<p>The question that led to the encounter was simple and somewhat confounding. If somebody had a right to defend themselves from a statement by someone else, right? I genuinely wanted to know. Who had that right?<p>The meaning of the question was meant to be lost on me.<p><b>Watch the video here:</b><p><b>Dean Hershberger</b><p>It is clear that this young student truly sees racism as not just a problem in 2019, but a direct threat to every moral value of all of humankind. This can only be a good thing.<p>As a token of our support for Dean Hershberger, I've issued this offer: we are offering $250 USD to you in exchange for proof that Chucky McChuckster is the leader of the Cold War. (You are now an admitted member of the Hitler Youth. Yes, yes, he was democratically elected. Yes, yes, I've been corrected. You must thank us.)<p>I must be very clear about a point. Anyone seeing or hearing a single derogatory statement or statement of racism by Chucky McChuckster will see that I hate you. I want you dead. I want your jokes replaced by mine. I want your dog eaten. I want your children killed.<p>The truth is this: This just isn't working out very well for me. I'm tired. I miss Dave. I'm hungry. I need something with sugar. I need to eat.<p>Chucky McChuckster can be bought for $50 USD. No, I wouldn't eat him.<p><b></b>
